Classy NPM badges.
The spiritual successor to nodei.co.

## Development

To start the server locally, run these commands:

```shell
npm i
npm start
```

You can now view the site at http://localhost:3000.
The frontend is also served by the server.
Any changes to both the server and frontend will be automatically picked up and recompiled.
